🎓 Student Record Management System using Linked Lists in C++

This project implements a menu-driven student management system using four different types of linked lists in C++. It allows operations like inserting, deleting, searching, and displaying student records in various linked list structures.

## 🧠 Data Structures Explained

 1. ✅ Singly Linked List
- Nodes connected in one direction using next
- One-way traversal

2. ✅ Doubly Linked List (DLL)
- Each node has prev and next
- Two-way traversal
- Linear (ends at NULL)

 3. ✅ Circular Singly Linked List (CSLL)
- next of last node points to first node
- One-way circular traversal

 4. ✅ Circular Doubly Linked List (CDLL)
- Nodes have prev and next
- next of last points to head, prev of head points to last
- Two-way circular traversal

How to Compile and Run a C++ Program (Theoretical Explanation)
Before executing a C++ program, it must go through two main steps: compilation and execution. Here's how each step works conceptually:

🔹 1. Writing the Source Code
You begin by writing your program using the C++ programming language.

This code is saved in a file with a .cpp extension (e.g., linked_list.cpp).

The source code contains logic, data structures (like linked lists), and instructions for the program.

🔹 2. Compilation
The source code must be converted into machine code that your computer can understand.

This is done using a C++ compiler.

The compiler reads the .cpp file and checks for syntax errors.

If there are no errors, it generates an executable file (a program that can be run directly).


📌 Menu Example
## Each program provides a menu like this:

1. Insert at beginning
2. Insert at end
3. Insert at position
4. Delete from beginning
5. Delete from end
6. Delete from position
7. Search for element
8. Display
9. Exit
